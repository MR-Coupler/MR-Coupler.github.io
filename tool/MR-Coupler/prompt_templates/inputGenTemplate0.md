Review the previous chat history and context. 

Your task is to:
1. For each generated metamorphic relation (MR), apply it to a diverse set of test inputs, thereby constructing <M> test cases per MR. 
For example, for MR1, generate the new tests as testMR1_1() through testMR1_<M>(); 
for MR2, generate the new tests as testMR2_1() through testMR2_<M>(); and so on.
2. Following the previous **REQUIRED DELIVERABLE** requirement, just update the test class by adding new generated test cases.
